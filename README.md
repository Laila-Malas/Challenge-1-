Leverage the World Weather Repository, a continuously updated database of daily weather information for cities worldwide, to develop a robust weather forecasting model. This repository provides actual recorded weather conditions, including temperature (high, low, average), humidity, wind speed and direction,
precipitation, and weather descriptions. Your task is to build a model capable of accurately forecasting daily temperatures for a chosen city or region. Consider factors such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection (e.g., time series models, machine learning algorithms), and model evaluation. 
Demonstrate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics and explain your approach to data analysis and model development. The accuracy and reliability of your temperature forecasts will be key factors in the judging process.

This dataset provides daily weather information for capital cities around the world. Unlike forecast data, this dataset offers a comprehensive set of features that reflect the current weather conditions around the world.
**Starting from August 29, 2023**.
It provides over 40+ features , including temperature, wind, pressure, precipitation, humidity, visibility, air quality measurements and more. The dataset is valuable for analyzing Global weather patterns, exploring climate trends, and understanding the relationships between different weather parameters.
